b_two:
  a_1: Simple most common text
  b_two: |
    This is the best way of
    inputing large chunks of text
    in the YAML files.
    
    Note that this format keeps blank
    lines in the same indentation.
  d_four: "We can also 
    use the boring \"
    accross multiple lines 
    but have to escape then."
  e_five: Or you can do it 
    like that as well, it also works.
  c_three:
      a: "Marcelo"
      d_4: Rafael
      # Your comments will be untouched
      # but will be bound to the element
      # on top of them (d_4 here).
      "b": Bernardo
      c_3:
          unify: Luiz
          klass: Lucas
a_one: > 
  This is another way 
  of inputing text. It
  will squish whitespace
  when deserialized
  (like HTML does).
